# hello_world
This is my first contact with githb (now I know how to spell it) :)

Something about my self.
My name is Andres Nino, I am an Electronic Enginner, I live in Sydney - Australia
I alwas was interested in learn how to program. I have done a few things in the electronic area involved hardware, but I realize that the software area could be much fun! 
That is why I am here, learning Github 

this is new comment to check how this thig works
if I change this I get new file on github?
